During analysis of a simulated environment, I identified a critical security misconfiguration that allowed unauthorized access through anonymous FTP, ultimately leading to credential exposure and full root compromise. Initial enumeration revealed externally accessible FTP and SSH services, with anonymous authentication enabled on FTP—a high-risk condition from a SOC perspective. Further investigation uncovered sensitive files stored in a world-readable directory, including encrypted backups and cryptographic material. A weakly protected private key enabled offline password cracking, which exposed hashed credentials and allowed privileged access via credential reuse.

From a defensive standpoint, this incident demonstrated how poor access controls, weak cryptographic practices, and lack of monitoring can combine to create a complete system compromise. The exercise reinforced the importance of service hardening, least-privilege file permissions, strong credential hygiene, and comprehensive logging. It strengthened my ability to analyze exposed services, assess impact, identify detection opportunities, and clearly document findings—approaching incidents with a SOC mindset focused on investigation, impact, and remediation rather than exploitation.
